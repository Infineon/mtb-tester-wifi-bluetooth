## Hardware setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

**Note:** The PSoC&trade; 6 Bluetooth&reg; LE pioneer kit (CY8CKIT-062-BLE) and the PSoC&trade; 6 Wi-Fi Bluetooth&reg; pioneer kit (CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT) ship with KitProg2 installed. The ModusToolbox&trade; software requires KitProg3. Before using this code example, make sure that the board is upgraded to KitProg3. The tool and instructions are available in the [Firmware Loader](https://github.com/Infineon/Firmware-loader) GitHub repository. If you do not upgrade, you will see an error like "unable to find CMSIS-DAP device" or "KitProg firmware is out of date".

## Software setup

- Install a terminal emulator if you don't have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en)

- Setting up iPerf on the host

  - [iPerf 2.0.13](https://sourceforge.net/projects/iperf2/files/) (supported on Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows)

  - Go to the iPerf installation directory and launch the terminal (command prompt for Windows, terminal shell for macOS or Ubuntu).

- Setting up the LE CoC application on the [CYW920719B2Q40EVB-01](%) peer device

  - On the ModusToolbox&trade; project creator, select the device CYW920719B2Q40EVB-01 and create a LE Connection Oriented Channel application

  - Build the [le_coc](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-examples-CYW920719B2Q40EVB-01-btsdk-ble/tree/master/ble/le_coc) application to run LE connection-oriented channel (CoC) on the peer device. This is part of the ModusToolbox&trade; BTSDK.

  - See [Building the code examples](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-examples-CYW920719B2Q40EVB-01-btsdk-ble#building-code-examples) for build and installation instructions.

  **Note:** Ensure that the LE CoC application is configured to run without pairing enabled, using the client control setting.

## Using the _Wi-Fi Bluetooth® tester_

Create the project and open it using one of the following:

<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox&trade; Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool.

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click the link from the **Quick Panel**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. The **Application(s) Root Path** defaults to the Eclipse workspace which is usually the desired location for the application. If you want to store the application in a different location, you can change the *Application(s) Root Path* value. Applications that share libraries should be in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In command-line interface (CLI)</b></summary>

ModusToolbox&trade; software provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and the command line tool, "project-creator-cli". The CLI tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the "project-creator-cli" tool. On Windows, use the command line "modus-shell" program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; software installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; software tools. You can access it by typing `modus-shell` in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The "project-creator-cli" tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

<br />

The following example clones the "[mtb-tester-wifi-bluetooth](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-tester-wifi-bluetooth)" application with the desired name "Wi-Fi_Bluetooth_tester" configured for the *CY8CPROTO-062-4343W* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id CY8CPROTO-062-4343W --app-id mtb-tester-wifi-bluetooth --user-app-name Wi-Fi_Bluetooth_tester --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

**Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can invoke the Library Manager GUI tool from the terminal using `make library-manager` command or use the Library Manager CLI tool "library-manager-cli" to change the BSP.

The "library-manager-cli" tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--add-bsp-name` | Name of the BSP that should be added to the application | Required
`--set-active-bsp` | Name of the BSP that should be as active BSP for the application | Required
`--add-bsp-version`| Specify the version of the BSP that should be added to the application if you do not wish to use the latest from manifest | Optional
`--add-bsp-location`| Specify the location of the BSP (local/shared) if you prefer to add the BSP in a shared path | Optional

<br />

Following example adds the CY8CKIT-062S2-43012 BSP to the already created application and makes it the active BSP for the app:

   ```
   library-manager-cli --project "C:/mtb_projects/Wi-Fi_Bluetooth_tester" --add-bsp-name CY8CKIT-062S2-43012 --add-bsp-version "latest-v4.X" --add-bsp-location "local"

   library-manager-cli --project "C:/mtb_projects/Wi-Fi_Bluetooth_tester" --set-active-bsp CY8CKIT-062S2-43012
   ```

</details>

<details><summary><b>In third-party IDEs</b></summary>

Use one of the following options:

- **Use the standalone [Project Creator](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool:**

   1. Launch Project Creator from the Windows Start menu or from *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/project-creator.exe*.

   2. In the initial **Choose Board Support Package** screen, select the BSP, and click **Next**.

   3. In the **Select Application** screen, select the appropriate IDE from the **Target IDE** drop-down menu.

   4. Click **Create** and follow the instructions printed in the bottom pane to import or open the exported project in the respective IDE.

<br />

- **Use command-line interface (CLI):**

   1. Follow the instructions from the **In command-line interface (CLI)** section to create the application.

   2. Export the application to a supported IDE using the `make <ide>` command.

   3. Follow the instructions displayed in the terminal to create or import the application as an IDE project.

For a list of supported IDEs and more details, see the "Exporting to IDEs" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

## Operation

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Modify the `WIFI_SSID` and `WIFI_KEY` macros in *main.c* to match with those of the Wi-Fi network that you want to connect to.

3. To join a Wi-Fi network of a specific band, update the `WIFI_BAND` macro in *main.c* as follows:

   `CY_WCM_WIFI_BAND_2_4GHZ` : 2.4-GHz band
   `CY_WCM_WIFI_BAND_5GHZ`   : 5-GHz band

4. Configure the TCP window size in iPerf before building the application. See the command console library's [Readme.md](https://github.com/Infineon/command-console/blob/master/README.md) for instructions on how to configure the TCP window size.

5. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud.

6. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade;</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
      </details>

   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. You can specify a target and toolchain manually:
      ```
      make program TARGET=<BSP> TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TARGET=CY8CPROTO-062-4343W TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
</details>

   **Note:** 

   - For CYW943907AEVAL1F and CYW954907AEVAL1F kits, use the BSP `latest-v1.X` tag available.

   After programming, the application starts automatically. Observe the messages on the UART terminal, and wait for the device to make the required connections.

7. The application connects to the configured Wi-Fi access point (AP) and obtains the IP address. When the device is ready, the `>` prompt appears.

8. Run iPerf commands (client and server) against a remote peer device.

   - See [Running iPerf client and server against a remote peer device](https://github.com/Infineon/command-console#iperf-command).


9. Run Bluetooth® LE commands against a remote peer device.

   - A remote peer device can be the LE CoC application on a [CYW20719B2Q40EVB-01](%) kit.

   - See [Running  Bluetooth® LE commands against a remote peer device](https://github.com/Infineon/command-console#ble-commands).

**Note:** CYW943907AEVAL1F and CYW954907AEVAL1F kits do not support Bluetooth commands.

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For more details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

**Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice – once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.infineon.com/docs/DOC-21143) to learn about this and for the workaround.

## Design and implementation

The main function initializes wifi-connection-manager and connects to an AP whose details are specified. The command-console library is initialized which allows you to test the Wi-Fi,  Bluetooth®, and iPerf commands through command line.
